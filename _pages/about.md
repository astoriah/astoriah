My work focuses on promoting and improving healthy aging with a human-centric and interdisciplinary approach. 

I have unique Health Informatics background with a BS in Gerontology from USC & MIMS from UC Berkeley's School of Information. My technical skillset focuses around in product design, qual + quant research, and data visualization. 

Innovation in aging can take place anywhere. For me, I found innovation at AgeTech startups, a non profit - AARP's Innovation Labs, and now at a research center at UW.
